## 🔍 About Me

I’m a **security-focused IT systems engineer** with 10+ years of experience in infrastructure, automation, and cybersecurity operations.

- ☁️ **Cloud Security Architecture** (AWS + Azure)  
- 🔐 **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** and Zero Trust alignment  
- 🧩 **Security Automation** with PowerShell, Python & SIEM integrations  
- 📜 **Compliance Mapping** to NIST 800-53 and CIS Benchmarks  
- 🧠 **Incident Response & Detection Engineering** (Splunk, Wazuh, MITRE ATT&CK)
