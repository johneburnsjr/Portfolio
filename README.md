## 🔍 About Me

I'm a security-focused IT professional with over 10 years of experience in systems administration and cybersecurity. My work emphasizes **cloud security**, **identity and access management**, and **security automation**. I thrive at the intersection of hands-on security engineering and clear, actionable documentation.

Currently expanding my portfolio to include:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform
- **AWS Cloud Architecture**
- **Compliance Mapping** to NIST 800-53 and CIS benchmarks
- **Documentation for ATO-readiness and SSP artifacts**
