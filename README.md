## 🔍 About Me

I’m a **security-focused IT systems engineer** with 10+ years of experience in infrastructure, automation, and cybersecurity operations.  
My work bridges **hands-on engineering** and **clear communication** — I design, secure, and document systems that scale.

Currently focused on:

- 🧱 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform & Azure ARM templates  
- ☁️ **Cloud Security Architecture** (AWS + Azure)  
- 🔐 **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** and Zero Trust alignment  
- 🧩 **Security Automation** with PowerShell, Python & SIEM integrations  
- 📜 **Compliance Mapping** to NIST 800-53 and CIS Benchmarks  
- 🧠 **Incident Response & Detection Engineering** (Splunk, Wazuh, MITRE ATT&CK)

## 💼 Projects in Focus

### 🔐 EC2 Secure Deployment with Terraform
A minimal, compliant AWS workload designed for security from the start.  

**Highlights**
- Infrastructure as Code deployment using Terraform  
- Hardened AWS EC2 with least-privilege IAM roles  
- CloudWatch & GuardDuty integration  
- Documentation mapped to NIST 800-53 (AC, AU, SI, SC families)

### 🧠 Identity & Access Management (IAM) Automation
Simplifying and securing identity lifecycles across Azure AD (Entra ID) and Okta.  

**Includes**
- PowerShell scripts for group lifecycle and MFA enforcement  
- Automated access reviews & compliance reports  
- RBAC mapping and zero-trust documentation

### 🚨 Threat Detection & Incident Response
Home SOC-style project focusing on real-time visibility and automated response.  

**Stack**
Splunk • Wazuh • Windows Server • Ubuntu • MITRE ATT&CK  

**What I Built**
- Automated log ingestion with PowerShell → Splunk  
- Detection logic for failed logins & PowerShell abuse  
- Auto-response script: disable user after failed login attempts  
- Visualization dashboards for alert monitoring
